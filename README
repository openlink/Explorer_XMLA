SPASQL Query Builder
======================

The SPASQL Query Builder is a simple iSQL-like sample HTML5 program which
allows connection to any browser accessible XMLA web service endpoint.

Once connected, a list of available data sources is displayed, and
users can easily explore the database schema and/or execute queries
against them.
